# Python Projects

This repository contains various Python projects, focusing on different areas of data analysis, programming, and problem-solving. Below is a list of the projects I have worked on:

## Projects Overview

1. **Cardiovascular Disease Prediction**
   - The primary goal of this project is to analyze the cardiovascular disease dataset and build a logistic regression model that predicts the likelihood of developing coronary heart disease within the next 10 years. The structure is roughly as follows:
   - Features: `age`, `sex`, `BMI`, `systolic_blood_pressure`, `cholesterol`, and others.
   - Techniques used: Logistic regression, feature engineering, data preprocessing, and model evaluation.
   - The project was conducted in Jupyter Notebook, where I explored and cleaned the data, visualized insights, and built machine learning models interactively.
   - 

2. **Chess Program**
   - A program simulating chess piece movements with a specific focus on the rook's behavior.
   - Rook is designed to capture the first piece in its path, implementing basic chess rules.
   - Techniques used: Object-oriented programming (OOP), Python classes, and game logic.
